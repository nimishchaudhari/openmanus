# Building OpenManus: An Open-Source AI Agent Framework

I'll help you design a detailed architecture for an open-source alternative to Manus AI, focusing on practical implementation phases rather than providing all the code upfront. Let's organize this around a clear architecture with FastAPI integration for LLM inferencing and a simple CLI interface for end users.

## High-Level Architecture

OpenManus will be structured as a multi-agent system with specialized components that work together to accomplish complex tasks:

1. **Coordinator Agent**: Central orchestrator that manages workflow and communication
2. **Planner Agent**: Breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
3. **Knowledge Agent**: Retrieves and manages information needed for tasks
4. **Executor Agent**: Interacts with tools and external systems to perform actions
5. **Tool Integration Layer**: Standardized interfaces for various capabilities

## Phase 1: Core Framework

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The foundation of OpenManus will be a modular agent architecture:

- **Coordinator Agent**:
  - Receives user requests and maintains the overall task state
  - Routes subtasks to appropriate specialized agents
  - Tracks progress and handles error recovery
  - Manages task persistence using Redis

- **Planner Agent**:
  - Analyzes user requests to determine required steps and dependencies
  - Creates directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of subtasks
  - Handles task prioritization and prerequisite relationships
  - Adapts plans based on execution feedback

- **Knowledge Agent**:
  - Manages information retrieval from vector databases (ChromaDB)
  - Provides context for other agents' decision-making
  - Handles search and information synthesis

- **Executor Agent**:
  - Interfaces with various tools (browser, APIs, data processing)
  - Translates high-level instructions into concrete actions
  - Reports execution status and results back to coordinator

### Model Integration with FastAPI

For LLM integration, we'll create a robust routing system with FastAPI:

```
/app
  /models
    model_router.py      # Handles model selection and routing
    model_server.py      # FastAPI server for model inference
    model_config.py      # Configuration for different models
  /core
    coordinator.py       # Coordinator agent implementation
    planner.py           # Planner agent implementation
    knowledge.py         # Knowledge agent implementation
    executor.py          # Executor agent implementation
```

The FastAPI server will:
1. Expose endpoints for different inference needs (planning, reasoning, execution)
2. Support routing between open-source models like Mixtral, Llama-3, or Mistral
3. Implement batching for efficient inference
4. Handle model loading and unloading based on memory constraints

For your MVP, focus on integrating with one primary open-source model first (like Llama-3) before implementing the more complex model routing system.

### Memory Systems

Three types of memory will be crucial:

1. **Episodic Memory**: Task history and conversation context
   - Implemented using Redis for persistence
   - Keeps track of past interactions and current session state

2. **Semantic Memory**: Knowledge storage
   - Implemented with ChromaDB for vector storage
   - Enables semantic search across knowledge base

3. **Procedural Memory**: Workflow templates
   - Stored in a graph database (Neo4j)
   - Records successful execution patterns for reuse

## Configuration

The LiteLLM model is configured using environment variables for the API key and model name. The configuration is managed in the `config.py` file.

## Getting Started

To get started with OpenManus, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Set the `LLM_API_KEY` and `LLM_MODEL` environment variables.
3. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the multi-agent framework.

```bash
python main.py
```
