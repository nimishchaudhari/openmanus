# Development Plan

## Recent Updates
- Refactored agent initialization to properly handle async event loops
- Improved test structure with focused integration tests
- Added proper error handling and task cancellation support
- Updated model router to work with LiteLLM

## System Components

### Memory Systems
- [x] Episodic Memory (Redis-based)
- [x] Semantic Memory (ChromaDB-based)
- [x] Procedural Memory (Neo4j-based)

### Agents
- [x] Coordinator Agent
  - Handles task distribution and management
  - Manages async initialization of components
  - Supports task cancellation
- [x] Knowledge Agent
  - Retrieves and processes relevant information
  - Integrates with semantic memory
- [x] Planner Agent
  - Creates execution plans
  - Handles task dependencies
- [x] Executor Agent
  - Executes tasks asynchronously
  - Supports parallel execution with worker pool
  - Proper event loop handling

### Model Integration
- [x] LiteLLM Integration
  - Support for multiple model providers
  - Fallback handling
  - Response caching
- [x] Model Router
  - Task-based routing
  - Capability matching
  - Error handling and retries

## Testing
- Integration Tests
  - Full system flow tests
  - Error handling tests
  - Task cancellation tests
- Model Router Tests
  - Routing and caching tests
  - Fallback model tests
  - Parameter override tests
- Memory System Tests
  - Storage and retrieval tests
  - Concurrent access tests
  - Data persistence tests

## Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
  - Automated testing
  - SQLite >= 3.35.0 requirement
  - Memory system dependencies
  - Coverage reporting

## Next Steps
1. Add more model providers through LiteLLM
2. Improve caching strategies
3. Add monitoring and observability
4. Implement rate limiting and quota management
5. Add support for streaming responses
